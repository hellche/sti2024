## When is Localized Expertise Required? Citation Patterns and References in Political Science Papers on Russia

*Authors:* Elena Chechik[1], Katerina Guba[2], Angelika Tsivinskaya[2], Arthur Pecherskikh[2]

**Summary**

In this study, we analyze citation patterns in English-language political science papers about Russia. We examine the prevalence of Slavic names among (a) the authors of 2,300 articles, (b) the authors cited in these articles, and (c) the authors citing these articles. Our results reveal a pattern: articles authored by individuals with Slavic names not only reference a greater number of sources with Slavic names but are also more frequently cited by authors with Slavic names. These findings suggest that (1) authors/co-authors who are potential native speakers may introduce additional sources into their references, and (2) there may be potential academic clusters or 'bubbles' within this research field.
